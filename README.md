# python-dash-project-assignment
**Python dash app built as a graded project assignment of the module "Data Analysis and Digital Reporting with Python".**

Task description:

Build a well structured dash application which includes the following pieces. For each company of the dow jones (selectable one by one):
1. An short info of the company (employees, headquarter, etc.) with its logo.
2. In a suitable (interactive) plot, for each case present:
earnings history of the last four quarters where you provide the historic estimates and actual realisations. Present the mean squared error of the difference.
earnings estimate for the current and next quarter, current year and next year. Include the respective lowest and highest estimates in your plot. Provide the number of analyst estimates as hover information in your plot.
3. a)
In a line plot, provide the stockâ€™s daily close price from the beginning of last year until
the current date.
b) Offer the possibility to view either the dow jones index or the sector mean in the plot of
the stock price, but with their own y axis.
c) Using a check box, include an ordinary least squares trend line for the single stock, which
is based on the data up to one month before the date of (each respective) execution, but extends to the current date.
4. Present a chart for the relative strength index with the option for horizontal lines, showing when the stock was overbought/oversold.
Take care of appropriate axes labeling and titles and/or descriptions of your different sections/plots.
Describe each part of your code using markdown cells. Explain for example why you would use a function (or why not). The volume of your explanations should be no more than 3 A4 pages.
